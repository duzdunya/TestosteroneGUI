# TestosteroneGUI, make design sigma again
<p>TestosteroneGUI is graphical user interface written in C and SDL.</p>

## About Project
<p>In my adventure of game development and learning C, the topic of graphical stuffs have always been exiciting for me.</p>
<p>When we consider the current status of programmers as obese creatures with colorful socks, the industry is becoming gay'er and we need to make programming masculine again. This is the very real purpose of project.</p>
<p>So that TestosteroneGUI has no aesthetic graphical design decisions.</p>
<p>For now it has only ability to render text and buttons with or without image.</p>
<p>If you want to have fancy widgets than make it and add pull request like a real man.</p>
<p>Since I considered rounded buttons as feminine, TestosteroneGUI has no rounded buttons. I think rounded buttons are feminine.</p>
